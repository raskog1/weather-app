# Weather Information Application

## Description

The assignment was to write a weather application utilizing the OpenWeather API. No code was supplied, so everything was written from scratch. The application is meant to show current weather conditions, including the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It is also meant to show a five day forecast indicating weather conditions, temperature, and date.
